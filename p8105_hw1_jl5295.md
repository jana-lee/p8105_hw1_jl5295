``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  sample=rnorm(8),
  logical_vector = sample > 0,
  char_vector = c("Help", "am", "I", "doing", "this", "correctly", "ahh", "ahh"),
  factor_vector = factor(c("red", "yellow", "blue", "red", "yellow", "blue","red", "red"))
)

mean_sample = mean(pull(problem1_df, sample))

mean_logical_vector = mean(pull(problem1_df, logical_vector))

mean_char_vector = mean(pull(problem1_df, char_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, char_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor_vector = mean(pull(problem1_df, factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, factor_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

**Problem 1 Comment** Problem 1 asks us to take a deep dive into
creating a dataframe. problem1\_df was created and allows us to explore
different types of vectors.

Then, we took the mean. The mean of sample is -0.2224873. Mean of
logical\_vector is 0.5. Both the mean of char\_vector and factor\_vector
generated a warning message. This does explain what is happening when we
try to take the mean because char\_vector and factor\_vector are not
logical or numerical
vectors.

## Second code chunk, with as.numeric function

``` r
# Convert the logical vector to numeric and multiply the random sample by 
# the result.
as.numeric (pull(problem1_df, logical_vector))*(pull(problem1_df, sample))

# Convert the logical vector to a factor and multiply the random sample by 
# the result.
as.factor (pull(problem1_df, logical_vector))*(pull(problem1_df, sample))

# Convert the logical vector to factor and then convert the result to nnumeric 
# and then multiply the random sample by the result.
as.numeric (as.factor (pull(problem1_df, logical_vector)))*(pull(problem1_df, sample))
```

# **Problem 2**

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm (500),
  y = rnorm (500),
  logical_vector = x + y > 1,
  numeric_vector = as.numeric (logical_vector),
  factor_vector = as.factor (logical_vector),
)
```

The dataset has 500 rows and 5 columns. The mean of x is 0.0081834. The
median of x is -0.0029011. The standard deviation of x is 1.0941979. The
proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is
0.224.

## Scatterplots

``` r
plota = ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x, y, color = logical_vector)) + geom_point()
plota
```

**Scatterplot comment:** There are two colors for the logical\_vector
scatterplot, one red and one green. There is a gradient of sky blue to
dark blue for the numeric\_vector scatterplot. There are two colors for
the factor\_vector, one red and one green. Saved plota as a PNG file.
Confirmed it is in the File Directory.
