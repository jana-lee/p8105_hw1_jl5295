Problem 1
```{r, creating_a_dataframe}
library (tidyverse)
problem1_df = tibble(
  sample=rnorm(8),
  logical_vector = sample > 0,
  char_vector = c("Help", "am", "I", "doing", "this", "correctly", "ahh", "ahh"),
  factor_vector = factor(c("red", "yellow", "blue", "red", "yellow", "blue","red", "red"))
)

mean_sample = mean(pull(problem1_df, sample))
  # Mean of sample is -0.2224873.

mean_logical_vector = mean(pull(problem1_df, logical_vector))
  # Mean of logical_vector is 0.5.

mean_char_vector = mean(pull(problem1_df, char_vector))
  # Mean of char_vector generated a warning message that says: In    mean.default(pull(problem1_df, char_vector)) :argument is not      numeric or logical: returning NA.

mean_factor_vector = mean(pull(problem1_df, factor_vector))
  # Mean of factor_vector generated a warning message that says: In mean.default(pull(problem1_df, char_vector)) : argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA.

```

## Second code chunk, with as.numeric function.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Convert the logical vector to numeric and multiply the random sample by the result.
as.numeric (pull(problem1_df, logical_vector))*(pull(problem1_df, sample))

# Convert the logical vector to a factor and multiply the random sample by the result.
as.factor (pull(problem1_df, logical_vector))*(pull(problem1_df, sample))

# Convert the logical vector to factor and then convert the result to nnumeric and then multiply the random sample by the result.
as.numeric (as.factor (pull(problem1_df, logical_vector)))*(pull(problem1_df, sample))

```

Problem 2
```{r}
problem2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm (500),
  y = rnorm (500),
  logical_vector = x + y > 1,
  numeric_vector = as.numeric (logical_vector),
  factor_vector = as.factor (logical_vector),
)
```
The dataset has `r nrow(problem2_df)` rows and `r ncol(problem2_df)`columns.
The mean of x is `r mean(pull(problem2_df, x))`.
The median of x is `r median(pull(problem2_df, x))`.
The standard deviation of x is `r sd(pull(problem2_df, x))`.
The proportion of cases for which x + y > 1 is `r mean(pull(problem2_df, logical_vector))`.

#Scatterplot of y vs. x
```{r}
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x, y, color = logical_vector)) + geom_point()
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x, y, color = numeric_vector)) + geom_point()
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x, y, color = factor_vector)) + geom_point()
```
